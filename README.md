## About The Project

### Mainstack - Task Management System

Mainstack is a task management system designed to help individuals and teams track, manage, and complete tasks more effectively. The project was developed with modern frontend technologies to ensure it’s both performant and scalable.

The project was completed under a time constraint, as I started working on it at 2 AM on Monday due to personal illness. Despite these challenges, I was able to deliver the project on time by using optimization techniques and focusing on clean, reusable components.

### Key Issues Faced:
1. **Font Issues**: There were difficulties in getting the correct font to display as expected in the application.
2. **Icons**: Some pages, including the settings page, were only available in the prototype and did not have accompanying icons or clear designs. This led to inconsistencies when trying to implement the required pages.
3. **Time Constraints**: Due to illness, I only started the assessment at 2 AM on Monday, which led to compressed development time and some compromise on the depth of features implemented.

## Built With

This section lists the major frameworks, tools, and technologies used to build the project:

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Next.js**: React framework for production with SSR and API routes.
- **TypeScript**: JavaScript with types for safer and more predictable code.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for fast UI development.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making requests.
- **React-SVGR**: Convert SVG icons to React components.
- **Other minor dependencies**: 
  - **Tailwind-merge** for merging utility classes in Tailwind.
  - **Next/font** for custom Google Fonts handling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you can run this project, you need the following software installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn** (for installing dependencies)

### Installation

To get started with the project:

1. Clone or fork the repository from GitHub:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/josephenoch/Mainstack.git
    ```
   
2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

3. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    pnpm dev
    ```

4. Open your browser and visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the app in action.

## Constraints

This project was built to test key frontend skills such as React components, React hooks, Next.js features, and the ability to write clean, maintainable code. While working on this project, several challenges arose:

### Key Constraints Faced:
1. **Use of Recent Technologies**: Frontend technologies are rapidly evolving, which caused some issues when using Jest and Next.js together. After some research, I resolved compatibility problems between the versions of Jest and Next.js.
   
2. **Design Problems**: There was a lack of design components, and the navigation for desktop users wasn’t clearly laid out. Some pages, like the settings page, were only present in the prototype, making it hard to fully implement the intended features.

3. **Illness and Time Constraints**: A personal issue caused a delay in the start of the assessment, with development only beginning around 2 AM on Monday. This impacted the initial development speed but was managed to ensure project completion within the available time frame.

### Recommendations for Improvement:
- **Create a Clear Design Document**: Developers and designers should collaborate early on to define design principles and user-centered development practices. A design document would provide a solid foundation for developers to work on.
  
- **Use Modern Design Concepts**: I used skeleton loaders as a modern approach to keep users informed that data was loading without disturbing the layout. It helps make the app more user-friendly and visually appealing.
  
- **Development Documentation**: A more detailed development process should be established to mitigate dependency conflicts. This would improve the speed and quality of development by standardizing the process and ensuring smoother collaboration.
